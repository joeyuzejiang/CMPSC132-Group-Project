### Abstract ###
Our team intends to make arcade games with pygame during the rest of the semester. We will need to go through the languages and libarary tutorials in order to grasp the skill and use it adeptly. 
Luckily, we all like to play games, and we experienced the era that the arcade games are the most popular. We want to restore the fun of our childhood, and that's why we intend to do the project.
