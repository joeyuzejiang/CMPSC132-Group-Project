# CMPSC132-Group-Project

### Abstract

Our team intends to make arcade games such as the snake game and Pac-Man with pygame during the rest of the semester. We will need to go through the languages and libarary tutorials in order to grasp the skill and use it adeptly. 
Luckily, we all like to play games, and we experienced the era that the arcade games are the most popular. We want to restore the fun of our childhood, and that's why we intend to do the project.


### Group Member: Yuze Jiang, Stephen Friel, Ky-Anh Nguyen

We believe that Github repository will be a great way for us to share our codes. Please share the email in the comment and we will add the professor in the repository.  


### Programming Language

Python, Pygame, Numpy?, PyTorch? (Time, Random)

**Pygame:**

Pygame allows us to make a screen to display pixels or colors, which are the basis to compose a game. After recalling what we have played before, we know that that the dots are generated randomly during the game, and that's will we will need to import random and time to improve the joy of the game. 

After getting fimiliar with pygame after making the snake game, we will start trying to make the Pac-Man, and it requires a high level technique. The movement of the eaters is more likely to be a procedure of training an AI. The procedure requires the knowledge of Numpy or PyTorch. We will develop further about how we will acheive the goal when after setup the environment. 


### Imediate Goal

**Yuze Jiang:**

Start learning pygame. Start writing the snake game environment code. 

**Stephen Friel:**

Start learning pygame. Start writing the player control part. 

**Ky-Anh Nguyen:**

Start learning pygame. Debugging. Find the upcoming needs in order to make the game playable.


### Long Term Goal

Our long term goal is to finish an arcade game collection. We know we have limited time, so that we will see how much time we have left after making the first two games: the snake game and Pac-Man. The long term goal for everyone is to learn pygame and able to use it adeptly. 


### Immediate Questions

Does the professor has any suggestions about where we went off the track or how we should start the project? Thanks!
