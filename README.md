# CMPSC132 Group Project

### Abstract

Our team intends to finish a project related to joint tracking, which is related to computer vision. We have some ideas about objects such as balls or cars, but we have not made a decision yet. We will have to train the computer so that it is able to recognize the specific object, and then it will be able to see the movement of it even if it is moving constantly. Personally, we believe that computer vision is the future, and the technique can be used in multiple areas. Especially, we will be able to use the knowledge of machine learning in the future, and thatâ€™s why we want to approach it now.

### Group Member: Yuze Jiang, Stephen Friel, Ky-Anh Nguyen

We believe that the Github repository will be a great way for us to share our codes. Please share the email in the comment and we will add the professor in the repository.

### Programming Language

OpenCV, Deep Learning, Python

We will be taking pictures to train the computer so that it is able to recognize the object in the image. OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer VIsion library. First, it is open source, which means we can easily access the codes. The algorithms will be helpful in training the machine learning model. Deep Learning provides a reliable machine learning algorithms.

### Immediate Goals

**Yuze Jiang**

Start reading opencv, deep learning documents. Try the examples online.

**Stephen Friel**

Start reading opencv, deep learning documents. Try the examples online.

**Ky-Anh Nguyen**

Not decided yet. 

### Long Term Goal

Try to finish a model with a 50% accuracy. We know that we have limited time, so that we will see how much we can do.

### Immediate Questions
 
Does the professor have any suggestions about where we went off the track or how we should start the project? Thanks!
